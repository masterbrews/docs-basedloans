# How it works

Based Loans is built on one of the oldest lending models in the world: the pawn shop. You deposit collateral, receive USDC, and have the option to buy your collateral back before the loan expires. No margin calls, no liquidations, no surprises. Every term is fixed the moment you borrow.

## What makes it work

#### ✔ No liquidations

Your collateral cannot be forcibly sold during the loan. Price volatility does not trigger any automatic action against you. The only two outcomes are: you buy back your collateral, or you walk away and the lender keeps it.

#### ✔ Fixed terms and fixed costs

The fee you owe is set at the moment the loan opens and never changes. You know exactly what it costs to get your collateral back before you ever sign the transaction.

#### ✔ Partial buybacks

You are not forced to buy back all of your collateral at once. You can reclaim any portion at any time before expiry, paying only the proportional share of the fee.

#### ✔ Lender-controlled risk

Lenders choose which tokens they will accept as collateral and set a USDC cap per token. This gives lenders direct control over the risk profile of their position without relying on protocol-wide governance.

#### ✔ Dual-source pricing

Collateral value is determined using two independent price sources: Pyth network price feeds and a time-weighted average price from a V3-compatible DEX pool. Using both sources together reduces the risk of either source being manipulated.

Based Loans removes the complexity that makes most DeFi lending stressful. Pick a term, deposit your collateral, receive USDC, and decide later whether to buy it back. That is the entire borrower experience.
