# Contract addresses

All Based Loans contracts are deployed on Base mainnet (chainId 8453) and verified on BaseScan. The addresses below are the only official deployments. Always confirm you are interacting with these addresses before approving any transaction.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never interact with a contract address that is not listed here. Scam deployments often use similar names or claim to be newer versions of official contracts. Based Loans does not publish new contract addresses outside of official channels: the X account [@based\_loans](https://x.com/based_loans) and this documentation.
