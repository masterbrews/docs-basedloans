# Oracle and pricing

When a borrower opens a loan, the protocol needs to know how much their collateral is worth at that exact moment. That value determines the loan amount, the buyback cost, and the buffer available to lenders. Getting this price right matters. Getting it wrong, in either direction, harms one side of the trade.

Based Loans uses up to two independent price sources and requires them to agree before a loan can open. Most assets use both a Pyth feed and a DEX TWAP. Some assets use a single TWAP source where no Pyth feed exists. The minimum source requirement is configured per asset by the protocol operator. This design is a structural defence against the most common class of DeFi exploit: oracle manipulation.

## Source 1: Pyth network

[Pyth](https://pyth.network) is a decentralised price oracle that aggregates data from professional market participants including trading firms, exchanges, and market makers. Pyth prices are published directly on-chain at high frequency and represent a consensus view of the current market price drawn from participants with direct access to real trading data.

Pyth is well suited to capturing the current spot price of a token across multiple venues simultaneously. A single large trade on one DEX does not move a Pyth price. Because contributors must stake to publish and their data is aggregated across many independent sources, manipulating a Pyth feed requires coordinating across a large number of independent contributors at once.

The Pyth oracle contract on Base is at [0x8250f4aF4B972684F7b336503E2D6dFeDeB1487a](https://basescan.org/address/0x8250f4aF4B972684F7b336503E2D6dFeDeB1487a). Based Loans interacts with it through a protocol-owned Pyth adapter at [0x85Ad3d6817646143e7076096D4A053ED38eFc958](https://basescan.org/address/0x85Ad3d6817646143e7076096D4A053ED38eFc958).

## Source 2: TWAP from a V3-compatible DEX pool

A TWAP, or time-weighted average price, is not the current price of a token. It is the average price over a recent time window, calculated from the recorded price history of a DEX liquidity pool. Rather than reading the price at a single block, the TWAP reads where the price has been over a period of time and averages it.

This matters for security. A flash loan or a single large trade can move the spot price of a token dramatically within one transaction. That same trade cannot move the TWAP, because the TWAP reflects accumulated price history, not the current tick. An attacker would need to sustain a manipulated price across many blocks, incurring real holding costs, to meaningfully shift the TWAP.

Based Loans supports two types of V3-compatible pool for TWAP reads: UniswapV3-style pools and Algebra-style pools. The protocol treats them consistently regardless of which DEX they run on. The relevant adapters are at [0xfcDafF6e23d22d430A19aabDefDb9B2Aa2975ba2](https://basescan.org/address/0xfcDafF6e23d22d430A19aabDefDb9B2Aa2975ba2) (UniswapV3) and [0x218CDFd5802fF3d6a22ffB14A41C3311EBfc2908](https://basescan.org/address/0x218CDFd5802fF3d6a22ffB14A41C3311EBfc2908) (Algebra).

## How the sources are combined

The OracleManager reads all configured sources at the moment a loan open transaction is processed. If all sources return a price and the readings are within an acceptable range of each other, the protocol uses their combined reading to determine the collateral value and the resulting loan amount.

The loan cannot open if any of the following conditions apply:

* A required source is unavailable (stale Pyth feed, pool with insufficient cardinality, or missing oracle configuration for the asset).
* Sources return prices that diverge beyond the acceptable threshold, suggesting one has been temporarily pushed away from fair value.

A successful loan open is evidence that all configured pricing mechanisms agreed on the value of the collateral within a narrow band at that moment.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a loan fails to open due to an oracle check, you will see an error message in the interface. In most cases, retrying after a short delay will resolve it as prices update or settle. If the failure persists, it may indicate an issue with liquidity or feed availability for that specific token.
{% endhint %}

## Price is locked at loan open, not tracked during the loan

Once a loan opens successfully, the price used for that loan is frozen. The protocol does not monitor collateral prices during the loan period. It does not check whether the token has fallen or risen. It does not revalue the position.

This is deliberate. It is the property that eliminates liquidations from the model entirely. Because there is no floating ratio to breach, there is nothing to liquidate. The only two outcomes are the borrower choosing to buy back at the agreed price, or the borrower allowing the loan to expire and the lender claiming the collateral.

The price oracle does its job once at loan open and then steps aside. Everything that follows is governed by the terms agreed in that opening transaction.

## Summary

* Most assets use two independent price sources: Pyth network and a DEX TWAP. Some assets use a single TWAP source where no Pyth feed exists.
* Pyth represents current consensus price across professional market participants.
* The TWAP represents average price over recent time, making it resistant to single-block manipulation.
* All configured sources must be available and agree within a threshold for the loan to open.
* If any required source fails or prices diverge significantly, the loan is blocked.
* Once a loan opens, the price is locked permanently for that loan. No mid-loan price tracking occurs.
* Using multiple independent sources means manipulating the oracle requires attacking all of them simultaneously.
